Description of the Tic Tac Toe Code
The code implements a command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python, which allows for two gameplay modes: single-player (against the computer) or two-player (human vs. human). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its main components:

Game Board Representation:

The game board is a 3x3 grid represented as a list of lists, initialized with spaces to denote empty cells.
Functionality:

print_board(board): This function displays the current state of the game board to the players.
check_winner(board): This function checks the board for a winner by examining all rows, columns, and diagonals.
is_board_full(board): This function checks if the board is full (i.e., there are no empty spaces left).
player_move(board, player): This function allows a player to input their move by specifying a number (1-9) corresponding to the grid position. It validates the input and updates the board.
computer_move(board, player): In single-player mode, this function allows the computer to make a random valid move.
Main Game Loop:

The game begins by prompting the user to select the mode (single-player or two-player).
Players take turns making their moves on the board:
In two-player mode, players alternate between 'X' and 'O'.
In single-player mode, the human player plays as 'X', while the computer plays as 'O'.
After each move, the game checks for a winner or if the board is full, indicating a tie.
The game concludes by announcing the winner or indicating a tie, and the program will exit.
Key Features:
User input is validated for correctness.
The computer's moves are randomized for unpredictability.
The game's user interface is simple and interactive, designed for command-line use.
